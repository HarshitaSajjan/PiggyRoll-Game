# PiggyRoll-Game
PiggyRoll-Game Project  This Pig Game project is an engaging and interactive web-based game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM). 



Game Rules:

The goal is to be the first player to reach 100 points.
Players take turns rolling a dice, accumulating points in each turn.
Points from the turn are added to the player's account when the turn is passed to the opponent.
If a player rolls a 1, they lose the points from that turn, and the turn is passed mandatory.



Key Features:

HTML for structuring the game layout.
CSS for styling and enhancing the visual appeal.
JavaScript for implementing game logic and interactivity.
DOM manipulation for updating the game state dynamically.
